# tkinker: SQLite GUI

![demo](notebooks/resources/sqlite_gui_demo.GIF)

Using tkinter and SQLAlchemy libraries, created a simple graphic user interface to easily interact with and filter a database.  The dataset used here was collected from a Kaggle post for video game sales last updated in 2017; it contains sales data from more than 16,500 games.  The user can scroll through the top video games in the list, or select categories to compare by.  Using the search form, the user can filter the entire database of video games either by their release platform, year of release, genre, or publisher.  The reset button returns the display to its original state, with all video games listed.
